## --- HOW TO RUN --- <br />

Windows: <br />
Place the exe in the same directory as the endfield.exe <br />
then run the unlocker exe and input the desired FPS value. <br />

Linux: <br />
use the same proton version as game and run the exe. <br />
(Note, EXE must be in the same directory that Proton installed the game to, directly next to the endfield.exe <br />
This is usually at ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/ one of the folders in there will have the game)
Then add this command to endfield launch options: <br />

## -- HOW TO UNINSTALL <br /> 
Remove vulkan-1.dll from root directory <br />
Remove ace_inject.dll from root directory <br />

Note: <br />
I am not responsible if this gets your account banned, <br />
I am personally yet to be banned however, <br />
so I believe this is safe to use. <br />
